Plants are known for having senses and personality that we humans cannot perceive and this is shown in their leaves and how they bloom.
This project is to use tech to bring that connection to nature. How would one interact with nature if those senses were perceived?
Live Plant consists of a natural plant having their leaves attached to vibrator motors or alligator clips that are connected to different sounds.
This brings the aspect of life into the plant as it vibrates when one approaches it giving it a sense of fear and then plays a screaming sound when one of its leaves are touched.
Different sections of the leaf plays different sounds, bringing the aspect of life as their personality is represented in their leaves. 
This is an interactive work intended to get people looking at nature in a close connection rather than as objects.
